<H3>üìÑ Microsoft Office 2021 Description:</H3>

Microsoft Office 2021 demonstrates well how the approach to creating, 
documents and working with them together has changed today.  Therefore, Office 2024 was made conceptually different. Almost all key elements 
in it were developed from scratch, and the applications are focused on a single style of work 
regardless of the hardware platform. They are designed to provide familiar functionality on any device, 
automatically! Many of us start working on one computer, 
continue it on another, and demonstrate it on a third, while simultaneously making minor edits on a laptop, 
tablet, or even a smartphone.
